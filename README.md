University Notes
================

This is a collection of the notes which i have created throughout different
units I have studied at UWA. These notes are all created by myself, however some
may contain some images or text copied directly from lecture notes and or
relevant texts. Feel free to use them but there may be gaps in content and
potentially some wrong information!

PHIL2002
--------

This was a really fun unit and I learnt a lot from it. Something to keep in mind
with this unit is that; while none of the tutorials are compulsory - you need to
at least do the practice questions to do well in it.

Had I been able to go back in time I would have:

\* Attended all tutorials (easier to do the work with someone there to help
you),

\* Read some of the available textbooks on the relevant logic (the open source
one that Samuel Baron linked on LMS looked really good!),

\* Taken pseudo-code style notes on how to do each procedure when initially
shown it.
